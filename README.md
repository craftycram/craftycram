# Hey there ðŸ‘‹

**I'm Marc, a full-stack developer with a focus on the back-end and infrastructure part of it.**

Through my studies in internet of things at @hfg-gmuend I speak the language of **design and development**. I'm not the perfect data scientist, nor the best UI designer, but I know both worlds and therefore able to build **projects from start to finish**. From the baseline of hardware and software infrastructure to the stroke width of the icons used in my frontends.  
I **love solving problems** that challenge me. If you need help solving a problem hit me up through one of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.marcrufeis.de/socials">my socials</a> or via my email linked in my profile.

Not convinced? Take a look at my projects in here or some others that aren't public on GitHub on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.marcrufeis.de/">my website</a>. If you want to take a deeper look at one of those let me know and we'll have a little chat about them.
